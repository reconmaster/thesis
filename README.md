# Thesis

## About

Repository for my thesis. Though it is in the development phase, the
README will be updated to reflect the design of the source code.

## Design

Here are a few ideas I have about the overall approach.

* I will break each chapter up separate tex files.
* In the drafting phase each component will be drafted into a file
  that can be broken into chapters later.
* It maybe useful to use org mode depending on how well I can figure
  out the latex output customization.

## Sections

Here is a rough layout of the different sections.

* ref.bib: The list of sources. It maybe worth using latex instead of
  org-mode if I can't get reftex working in org-mode. Given the number
  of references that will go into the thesis, reftex will probably be
  critical.
* review.tex: This is currently the draft of the literature review.
  Starting with this section will help me keep develop a better
  understanding of the field.
